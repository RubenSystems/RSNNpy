# RSNNpy
A simple library for creating neural networks in python


Implements a neural network with Dense, Dropout and Output layers. Activation functions are ReLU and Sigmoid. Currently uses mean squared as the error function but categorical cross entropy will be added for classification models. Learning rate and batches will also be added soon. 

A C++ version with Python bindings is also in the works, it is more efficient and has a saving function.
